# 🛰️ AgTech ML: Hyperspectral Agriculture Classification

  
🚀 Overview

**AgTech ML** is a Machine Learning project focused on applying remote sensing and advanced algorithms to precision agriculture. The core objective is to accurately **classify different crop types** and assess **crop health** using **hyperspectral satellite imagery**. This solution provides high-resolution, predictive insights that assist farmers and agricultural strategists in optimizing resource management and improving yields.

The project utilizes a data pipeline that includes image processing, feature extraction, and the comparative evaluation of multiple machine learning classifiers.

🎯 Project Objectives

## 📊 Dataset

The analysis relies on two publicly available, high-quality agricultural image datasets from Kaggle, crucial for the classification task:

| Dataset Name | Source | Purpose in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PlantDoc Dataset** | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/plantdoc-dataset) | Used for **plant disease detection** and fine-tuning models on a diverse, real-world image collection. |
| **PlantVillage Dataset** | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitsingh1804/plantvillage) | Used for **initial crop health classification** and providing a foundational set of labeled images for model training. |

✅ **Feature Engineering:** Process raw spectral bands to extract meaningful features relevant to crop type and health.
✅ **Comparative Modeling:** Implement and evaluate performance across classical and deep learning models, specifically **Random Forest (RF)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.
✅ **Classification:** Achieve high-accuracy classification of various **crop types** using the selected optimal model.
✅ **Geospatial Insights:** Demonstrate the ability to visualize predicted classifications as geospatial maps for actionable intelligence.
